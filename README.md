## University of Missouri Senior Capstone Project

A python app that imports information from an sql database to be parsed from a local mysql database for parsing and manipulation. The app will use Django to manage front end and backend logic so that data may be presented in a easy to comprehend manner to
users. UX and UI design will be implemented with vanilla Javascript as well as CSS styling. The app will allow these users to track subscription information such as: cost, expiration date, subscription length, subscription type, subscription name, and any other 
applicable information. 


## Project Goals

- Import Database information into a local data structure for analysis.
- Allow administrators to login and configure the data for the application to use.
- Enable users to log in and view their subscription information via a web applet.
- Enable users to indicate plans to renew or cancel.
- Enable Administrators to plan how many liscenses they will need to purchase in bulk.
- Enable Staff to ensure that money is not being unnecissarily spent on the same liscenses due to intra-departamental isolation.

## Introduction
In the modern world, every person is plagued with many subscriptions and monthly renewals. Keeping track of these is hard enough, but once someone becomes a college student, there occur many new types of subscriptions and services they need to keep track of. These services can be confusing to communicate with as some work through email, web pages, the application itself, or through school administrators. From Jira and zyBooks to Adobe and various cloud services, students can be opted into and made to utilize a plethora of platforms. License Renewal Application Tracker (LRAT) aims to solve this problem by making it easy and intuitive to manage all types of services the student is a part of, even ones they themselves may not be aware of.  

LRAT is our solution to the confusion by consolidating information and allowing ease of access. Our program will accomplish this with three roles. In a real scenario a student would be able to log in to the application like they would their email or canvas and be able to see their own licenses. A staff members experience would be very similar to a student, but some background processes will change as their license are renewed and tracked differently. Finally, an IT role would allow administrative actions such as pulling reports and modifying cost values.  

The application should be designed to be as user friendly as possible for students and staff as the primary purpose is to reduce confusion. To do this we will have features allowing consumers to easily find all their licenses, the price and renewal terms, and links or documentation on how to cancel or renew said licenses. This will be accomplished by ensuring minimal clutter, intuitive UI, and proper help resources.  

In our proposed project, we will work with the school's IT department to understand the format of their SQL data tables. This will allow the project to have real world application should they so desire. Our team will employ cyber security techniques to try and ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability. To acquire pricing information of various licenses we will utilize multiple means such as web scrappers and coordinating with sales reps to allow IT roles accurate information.
